        Each player chooses to either attack, defend, or attempt a finishing move.
        Each attack and defend value is determined by speed, strength, cunning, and random numbers.
        The attack value is compared to the defense value. If attack is greater than defense,
        fatigue is reduced by the difference. If one player defends and doesn't take damage,
        they get fatigue points back, but fatigue points will never go over their original fatigue.
        If both players defend, both get a random number of fatigue points back. A finishing move is
        only available when one player's fatigue is double the other's or if a fighter's fatigue
        is below zero. Get ready to play!
